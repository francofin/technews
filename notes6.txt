A partial is a templating technique that isn't unique to Handlebars.js. 
Just like templates help minimize the repeated code across pages, partials help minimize the repeated code across templates. 
With partials, we can extract smaller components from a template to reuse in other templates.

That's rightâ€”to use a partial, all we need is the > character, followed by the name of the partial file and the object we'll pass to the partial.

When we pass the post object into the partial, we don't pass the object as is but rather pass in all of the properties of that object.
